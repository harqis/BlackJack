Command line BlackJack.

Rules: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack

No doubling, split or insurance. Dealer stays at 17 or over. BlackJack (card total 21) pays 2.5 to 1.

First, game asks name and amount of chips for the account from the user. Before every deal, user can bet chips from his/hers account. After that standard game of BlackJack is played. Deck is shuffled after every deal. Possible wins are added to user's chip account.

After every deal player is asked if he/she wants another.

Program starts by running main.py.

!!! Game is currently in Finnish. The language will be changed to English soon.

!!! (Currently trying to solve) Game logic is not currently perfect. If player or dealer gets 3 or 4 aces to hand, problems may occur.

Things to be added: multiple players, analysis of winning probabilities, ability to decide when deck is shuffled and a GUI perhaps.
