Command line Blackjack.

Rules: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack

No doubling, split or insurance. Dealer stays at 17 or over. Blackjack (card total 21) pays 2.5 to 1.

First, thegame asks name and amount of chips for the account from the user. Before every deal, the user can bet chips from his/her account. After that, a standard game of Blackjack is played. The deck is shuffled after every deal. Possible wins are added to user's chip account.

After every deal, player is asked if he/she wants another card.

Program starts by running main.py.

!!! (Currently trying to solve) Game logic is currently not perfect. If player or dealer gets 3 or 4 aces to hand, problems may occur.

Things to be added: multiple players, analysis of winning probabilities, amount of decks in play, ability to decide when deck is shuffled and a GUI perhaps.
